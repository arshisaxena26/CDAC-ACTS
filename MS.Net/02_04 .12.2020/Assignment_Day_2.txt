C# Assignment Questions :

1. Create your own class like the Array class and implement methods that:
	a. Sort an array using bubble-sort, quicksort
		*Bonus question: What is the complexity of bubble-sort and quicksort?
	b. Implement linear search on an array.
		*Bonus question: What is the complexity of linear search?
	 c. Implement a binary search algorithm on an array (both iterative and recursive) 
		*Bonus question: what is the complexity of the binary search algorithm for iterative and recursive versions?
	
**NOTE: Don't copy the implementation from elsewhere. Try implementing on your own.
Run your implemented algorithms through the debugger to understand how they are working.
