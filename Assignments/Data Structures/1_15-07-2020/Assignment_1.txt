Day 1

Q1. Implement the solution for the problem using Linked List approach.
    In linked list, we will store a number, as we read from it (if it is not present in the list). 
    Every number we read from stream, we search in linked list to find if it is duplicate or not.

Q2. Once #1 is implemented, try out the shared code. Change the type of array from "int" to "bool".

Q3. Try implementing the array as bit map, instead of array of "int" or "bool".
