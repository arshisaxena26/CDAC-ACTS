C# Assignment Questions:     
    
1. Implement a generic hashmap (also called as dictionary) in C#. 
   Use any one strategy to handle collisions: chaining or open addressing.

*Bonus: try implementing both the collision strategies.
*Bonus: What is the complexity of insert/delete operations and what is the space complexity?

**NOTE: Use exception handling for operations that might fail like out of capacity in your hashmap.



2. Assume you are implementing a temperature checker program. At periodic time intervals, 
   you should get a notification (use a delegate) that contains the temperature recorded and the time at which it was recorded. 
   Store the temperature and time values, that you receive in the notification, in a collection 
   (pick one appropriately according to what the use cases of the collection are) and then find out:
   
    a. At what point in time was the temperature lowest.
    b. At what point in time was the temperature highest.
    c. What was the avg temperature recorded.

3. Attached is a zip containing html files each one containing the most popular baby names in the US, year-wise and ranked. 
   Using regex, perform the following operations:
   
	a. Find and extract the year and print it
	b. Extract the names and rank numbers and print them
	c. Get the names data into a dict and print it
	d. Using the dict information, find out information about a given name like number of years during which it was in top 10.

4. Relevant exercises for company interviews:

   Represent a tree in C# and implement traversal methods. Hint:
   	 class Node<T> {
	  	T data;
	  	Node<T> left;
	 	Node<T> right;
   	 }
   	 class Tree {
      		Node<T> root;
      		...
      		// Methods like inorder, preorder, postorder
  	  }
  	  
    • What is the complexity of the traversal algos?
    • Implement a BST (Binary Search Tree) in C# and print all the elements.
    • What is the complexity of the printing algo?
