Day 16

Create RESTful web service for using a resource : Student
id,firstName,lastName,email(unique),dob(LocalDate),marks

1. Create a layered spring boot application 
Rest controller --Service --DAO repository --POJO
Instead of directly sending resource, use ResponseEntity
Test it with postman

Objectives:

1. List all students 
2. List all students with date of birth after a specific date--Date should be supplied as URI variable from front end.
3. List all students with lastname starting with some prefix--prefix should be supplied as URI variable from front end.
4. List all students with marks in the range of begin n end--begin and end should be supplied as request parameters.
   (test url : localhost:8080/students/marks?begin=60&end=100)

5. Create a new student record
{
        "firstName": "kiara",
        "lastName": "fraser",
        "email": "kiara@gmail.com",
        "dob": "1982-11-11",
        "marks": 29
    }

6. Delete existing student record
	i/p (via path var) : student id

7. Update student marks and last name

	(use put method)
	Send marks n lastName in JSON object format.
	Send student id using a URI variable.
	
	eg : URL(put method)  : http://host:port/students/1
	
	{
        "lastName": "fraser",
        "marks": 29
  	  }
