Day 10

Q1. Add following features in Day 9 assignment.
1.1 Add enum CustomerType with SILVER,GOLD,PLATINUM
1.2 Add HAS-A relationship between Customer & CustomerType
1.3 Make required changes.
1.4 Add another composition : Customer HAS-A ShippingAddress (for dispatching propducts ordered from online web site)
ShippingAddress : city,state,country,zipCode,phoneNumbers (String[]) : for landline n mobile number.
1.5 In the Tester , add another option 
Option 5 : Assign shipping Address
I/P : Customer email , city , state , country ,zip code &  2 phone numbers

Option 6 : Place Order
I/P customer email , product name , quantity
If shipping address is not yet assigned : throw custom exception (can't place order : assign address first!)
O.w : Display Message : Hello , customer name . Your product name will be delivered with next 3 working days.
(No actual logic of placing orders or shopping cart  is needed. Just display a message).

Q2. Understanding overriding of equals method

Create a Employee class (concrete)
: id(int), name(string), deptId(string),salary(double),joinDate(Date)

In Tester : main(...)
SimpleDateFormat sdf=new SDF("dd-MM-yyyy");
Employee e1=new Employee (101,"abc","rnd",12345,sdf.parse("1-5-2020");
Employee e2=new Employee (101,"abc","rnd",12345,sdf.parse("1-5-2020");
Employee e3=e1;
sop(e1.equals(e2));//#1 false
sop(e1.equals(e3));//# 2true

BUT in our emp based organization , unique identifier for Employee is emp id
Meaning 2 emps are same , if n only if their ids are same.

So get me "true o/p in #1" , w/o touching Tester class.

1.2 Change equality testing criteria
BUT in our emp based organization , unique identifier for Employee is emp id & dept id
Meaning 2 emps are same , if n only if their id & dept ids are same.
