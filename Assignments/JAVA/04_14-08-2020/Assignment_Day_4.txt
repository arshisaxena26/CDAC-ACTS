Day 4
Q1. Create a new eclipse project day4_lab
    Copy earlier created Point2D class in com.app.geometry package.
    Create a new TestPoints class in "com.app.tester" package for the following.

1.1 Prompt user , how many points to plot?
    Create suitable array , to store Point2D type of references.

1.2 Add a menu , Run the application till user chooses option 10 (exit)

	1 Plot a new point
	  I/P --index , x & y
	  eg : If user supplies 5 50 100
	  Create a Point2D with x, y of (50,100) & its reference should be stored at the 5th index position in array.

	2 Display all points plotted so far. (Use for-each)

	3. Calculate distance
           I/P strt , end point indexes.
           eg : If user enters 2 6
           Find out the distance between 2nd & 6th point. (array indexes start from 0)

	10. Exit

Note : Boundary condition checking & null checking is expected.
(Meaning : if user supplies index > array length -1 , then give error message : invalid index --out of range
If no point is plotted at user specified index , then give error message : invalid index -- no point plotted here.)

Q2. Create java application for the following.
    Create Student class  in package com.cdac.core

2.1 Every student must have   --- id(int) --if possible system generated(Hint : use static data member id counter : start with 1 n generate ids.), name (String), email(String), age(int),gpa

2.2 Add suitable parameterized constructor.
    Accept -- name,email,age only from user.

2.3 Add a method fetchDetails to  fetch student details
    (ret type -- String)

2.4 Add computeGPA method in Student class
    Accept 3 method arguments for : scores for quiz , test & assignments
    gpa should be computed on 20 % of quiz score, 50% of test score & 30% of assignment score.
    (1-10 scale)


2.5 Write a TestStudent class in tester package
    Prompt user for class size(how many students ?)
    Create suitable array.

-------	Menu --------

1. Admit new Student
   I/P student details (name,email,age)
   If there is a space , accept n store student details.
   Otherwise give error message : class capacity full!!!

2. Assign scores (quiz , test assignment all out of 100)
   I/P student's roll no & 3 scores  
   O/P In case of success : scores added & GPA computed!
   In case of failure : invalid student id.

3. Display details of topper

4. Exit
