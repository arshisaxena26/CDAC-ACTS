Angular Lab Assignments:

Day-7 :

Q1. Create an Angular application that display static content – “about us” (that will display some data) 
    and “contact us” (that will display some other data). 
    Both these contents must come from two different components.

Q2. Create a component people-list. 
    The component class must have a property “people” which is an array of json objects. 
    Each person must be described using name, age and gender. 
    The component must display all people details in a tabular manner. The array can be created as:
    	
    	people:any[] = [
		{"name":"Ria","age":23,"gender":"female"},
		{"name":"Dia","age":27,"gender":"female"},
		{"name":"Anish","age":20,"gender":"male"}
	];
	
    Output to be displayed in a table.
    
Q3. Create a module “Module1.ts” having two classes:

	1) a class “People” with properties “name”, “age” and “gender”.
	2) A class “Module” that exports a people array having people instances.
	
    In the people-list component, create Module1 instance and a method getAllPeople() that retrieves all people instances. 
    Display these people instances in neat tabular fashion. Use bootstrap classes for table.
