MEANSTACK - Assignment

jQuery assignment:

	1. Create a HTML with data in fields that behave like placeholders. But they ARE NOT HTML5 placeholders!
	   When user begins entering text in text field, the watermark must go away.
	   
	2. Create a jQuery webpage which accepts Shipping address and billing address from the user. 
	   If the billing address and shipping address were same copy the shipping address details to 
	   billing address and make it readonly.

Angular Assignment :

	Create a StudentService component that will perform the following operations:
	
		• getStudentDetails(int studId) – given studentId, fetch details of that student
		• getAllStudents() – fetch all students information
		• addStudent() – add a new student to server side
		
	The service component will fetch and store data to and from a RestFul Web service which you have already created in SpringBoot.
	Don’t create these services. I am assuming that all these services are up and running.
	
	Create a Angular component that displays a HTML template-driven form to accept student information. 
	Validate the information and store the student object to server side database using the studentService component 
	(use Http.post() method).
	
	Use the StudentService component again to fetch single student info and all students info. 
	Display the fetched details in neat fashion.
