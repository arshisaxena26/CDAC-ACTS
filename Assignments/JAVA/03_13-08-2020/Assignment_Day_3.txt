Day 3
Q1. Create Point class Point2D , under package com.app.geometry  : for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

1.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

1.2 Add public String getDetails()) --to return string form point's x & y co-ords

1.3 Add isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must ret. true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false 	otherwise. 

1.4 Add a method to Point2D class -- to create and return new point having given x & y offset.
	eg : Point2D p1=new Point2D(10,20);
	If user supplies offset of (5, -2) : your method should return a new point object placed at (15,18)

1.5 Add calculateDistance method to calculate distance between current point & specified point & return the distance to the caller.
	(eg double  calcDistance(Point2D p2))
	Hint : Use distance formula . Use java.lang.Math class methods --sqrt, pow etc.

1.6 Write TestPoint class , under "com.app.tester" package with a main method
	Accept co ordinates of 2 points from user (Scanner) --p1 & p2

1.7 Use show method to display point details.(p1's details & p2's details)

1.8 Invoke isEqual & display if points are same or different (i.e p1 & p2 are located at the same position)

1.9 Create new point p3 , with the dimensions offset from p1.
	I/P --x offset & y offset

1.10 Display distance between 2 points.(between p1 & p2)
